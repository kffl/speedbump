Speedbump is a TCP proxy written in Go which allows for simulating variable network latency.

## Usage

### Installation

The easiest way to install speedbump is to download pre-built binaries for your platform that are automatically attached to each [release](https://github.com/kffl/speedbump/releases/) under _Assets_. If you wish to build speedbump from source, clone this repository and run `go build`. Alternatively, you can run speedbump as a container using the [kffl/speedbump](https://hub.docker.com/r/kffl/speedbump) image.

### Basic usage examples

Spawn a new instance listening on port 2000 that proxies TCP traffic to localhost:80 with a base latency of 100ms and sine wave amplitude of 100ms (resulting in maximum added latency being 200ms and minimum being 0), period of which is 1 minute:

```
speedbump --latency=100ms --sine-amplitude=100ms --sine-period=1m --port=2000 localhost:80
```

or when running speedbump using the [kffl/speedbump](https://hub.docker.com/r/kffl/speedbump) container image:

```
docker run --net=host kffl/speedbump:latest --latency=100ms --sine-amplitude=100ms \
           --sine-period=1m --port=2000 localhost:80
```

Spawn a new instance with a base latency of 300ms and a sawtooth wave latency summand with amplitude of 200ms and period of 2 minutes (visualized by the graph below):

```
speedbump --latency=300ms --saw-amplitude=200ms --saw-period=2m --port=2000 localhost:80
```

</div>

### Combining latency summands

It is possible to run speedbump with multiple latency summands at once:
